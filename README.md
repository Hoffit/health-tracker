# CF Java 401 Android Applications Lab Work
Multiple labs to build my first android application.

## Health Tracker App
Concept is based on silly phone based exercises like pressing buttons.

### Feature Tasks
Espresso

Add Espresso tests for all of the Activities we’ve built so far. In particular, the Finger Exercises would benefit from testing, as would the image carousel.
Camera

Add the ability for users to enter a profile picture. Give them the option of taking a new photo with the camera, or using images already on their phone. Your app will need to request the appropriate permissions for this. Once users take a profile picture, you should display it on the homescreen.

Add testing for this flow once you’ve built it. (In general, you are now expected to write tests for any functionality you add to the app.)
